Compare unlimited items to find the best price! Save money in a smart way.

Simply give a name (optional), enter in the cost, amount and size of each item and the unit per dollar will be calculated. This then sorts those based off best value for you to easily find the best price! Three numbers is all that is required to get an accurate answer.
